//Prime Numbers
/**
 * Context: A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it cannot be divided by 4, 3, or 2; it can only be divided by itself (5) and 1. Similarly, the numbers 7 and 11 are prime. As numbers become larger, determining whether or not they are prime is increasingly difficult, but loops make this process relatively easy!
Write a script that accomplishes the following:
Declare an arbitrary number, n.
Create a loop that searches for the next prime number, starting at n and incrementing from there.
As soon as you find the prime number, log that number and exit the loop.
